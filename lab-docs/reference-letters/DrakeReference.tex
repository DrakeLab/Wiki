It is with enthusiasm that I nominate YOUR NAME for SOME AWARD OR FELLOWSHIP. Through my interactions with HIM/HER over the past blah blah years, I have observed YOUR NAME to have the following characteristics. (This paragraph is just the intro to lay out 2-3 qualities of the applicant that will be expounded upon below. It's also a good place for John to insert a line or two about himself and/or the lab). \\

YOUR NAME is especially BLANK. This is important (or overcomes the odds, or is particularly suited to this occasion, or is noteworthy in this context) because INSERT REASON HERE. For example ANECDOTE PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR PREVIOUS STATEMENT. \\

Further, YOUR NAME is especially BLANK. This is important (or overcomes the odds, or is particularly suited to this occasion, or is noteworthy in this context) because INSERT REASON HERE. For example ANECDOTE PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR PREVIOUS STATEMENT. \\

Lastly, I am impressed with YOUR NAME's committment to BLANK. This relates to the AWARD/FELLOWSHIP, in that REASON. One particular instance where YOUR NAME demonstrated BLANK was ANECDOTE PROVIDING EVIDENCE. \\

SOME BROAD SWEEPING STATEMENT ABOUT WHY YOU ARE PERFECT/DESERVING OF THIS AWARD. If I can provide any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. \\

Sincerely,\\
