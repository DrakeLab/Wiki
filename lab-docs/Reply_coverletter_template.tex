Please find enclosed with this letter our revised manuscript ``\msTitle" which we resubmit for publication as a research article in \textit{\Jname{}}.\\

%Short paragraph summarizing MS or reiterating merits from original coverletter


We thank the reviewers for identifying areas of weakness or confusion in the original manuscript.  
%Sentence summarizing changes to MS
 We have addressed specific comments below: \\

\textbf{Specific replies}

%Useful replies:
  	%We have adopted the referee's suggestion to ....
	% We take this point, and have considered different ways of responding. Figure 1 in the original manuscript (now Figure 2) shows the likelihood surface for the fit parameters, so it isn't conducive to plotting the data on the graph. The previous Figure 2 (now Figure 1) showed fitted curves without data. We've devised a new plot that shows three things: raw data, summarized data, and the fit model. Thus, the revised manuscript reports this new figure including the requested data. Further, we have also rearranged the figures so that this data figure (old Figure 2) now comes first.
	%This is a good point that we had not previously considered. In the revised manuscript we ....
	% We respectfully but strongly disagree with Referee 1, whose objections raised of our conclusions seem to be based on a misunderstanding of our analysis (the use of aggregated data instead of individual observations).  In the revised manuscript, we have clarified the use of the binary data along with conducting a sensitivity analysis.  We believe these steps address any concerns that  Referee 1 has raised with respect to our conclusions and analysis. 	% Thank you.
         %We see the point -- SUMMARY OF POINT. In revision, we have ..... We hope this satisfies the reviewer's concern without unnecessarily appealing to the concept of `component Allee effects' (which are not part of the present paper).
         %Thank you for this endorsement. We reply point wise to the specific concerns below.
	%Yes, thank you for this suggestion. In revision, our ...
	%Yes this was an oversight. Suggestion adopted (line 64).
	%This was poor expression on our part. The revised manuscript reads: ``... " (now line 64)

        %Thank you for this suggestion. XXX now reported in line 57 of the methods .
         %Yes, we find this curious, too! We conjecture that the mechanism concerns quorum sensing and are considering further experiments that might elucidate this point. However, this work is extremely preliminary and outside the scope of the current paper.
